- In the current project given below variables are hard coded:-

1. model_results --> the results of the ML component because indepth data was not provided. 
2. model_path --> because the ML model was not saved due to less information of the type of data to build a proper model
3. file_loc --> Currently the file location is static, Later we can make it dynamic
3. target_col --> By default the column is set as taget_col to differentiate later we can make the column dynamic
