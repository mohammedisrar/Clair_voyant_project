- In the current project given below variables are hard coded:-

1. model_results --> the results of the ML component
2. model_path --> because the ML model was not saved due to less information of the type of data to build a proper model
3. file_loc --> Currently the file location is static, Later we can make it dynamic
3. taget_col --> By default the column is set as taget_col to differentiate later we can make the column dynamic


- The inserted record is printed as well as a local host is created, Click on the host to view the recods insereted in the mongo DB


- Avoid turning on the debug mode in the Flask, the mongo DB currently has less memory
- Have kept the Mongo DB credentials visible so that you can validate the entered data
